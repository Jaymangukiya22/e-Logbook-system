    <p>In modern times, old style paper logbooks are still used to register and store the data related
        to transportation by university bus drivers. There is no such platform especially in MU to
        input/enter data online and store that data efficiently in a database. And, writing daily in a
        logbook every time might be a tedious task for drivers.
        In order to overcome the problem, e-Logbook website will be able to input data related to
        transportation such as kms. driven, time driven, starting/ending point, fuel etc. This data can
        be further stored in a database where it can be managed efficiently.
        On the admin side, admin can edit, add, remove drivers, students, bus routes etc. Also,
        student can check the status of bus from the student side. And drivers can input data from
        the driver side.</p>
